"""
HTTP is the hypertext transfer protocol which is considered as the foundation of the data transfer in the world wide web. All web frameworks including flask need to provide several HTTP methods for data communication.

The methods are given in the following table.

SN	Method	Description
1	GET	-->It is the most common method which can be used to send data in the unencrypted form to the server.
2	HEAD -->It is similar to the GET but used without the response body.
3	POST -->It is used to send the form data to the server. The server does not cache the data transmitted using the post method.
4	PUT -->It is used to replace all the current representation of the target resource with the uploaded content.
5	DELETE -->It is used to delete all the current representation of the target resource specified in the URL.
